## What are Arrays?
- Ordered collection of elements
- Each element has an index, starting from 0
- `["a","b","c"]` - key for `a` is `0`, `b` is `1` etc

## What are Hashes?
- Unordered collection of key-value pairs
- Each value is retrieved from their corresponding keys
- Implemented with dictionaries or maps
- `{ name: "Alice" }` - key is `name` and value is `"Alice"`
